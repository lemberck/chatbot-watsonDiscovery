# Aidan, the Coursera Virtual Assistant for Students
This is my Capstone Project for IBM's Applied AI Professional Certificate. Aidan is a virtual assistant/chatbot powered by Watson AI,
with Watson Discovery and Watson Assistant integration. With Discovery integration, Aidan has acess to a Coursera catalog with information 
about 500 courses JSON files using advanced NLP, Concept Tagging and Keyword Extraction enrichments as data mining features.
It was deployed at a Facebook Page. You can interact with Aidan here:
